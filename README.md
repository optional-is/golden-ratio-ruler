There are two different designs:

* Design 1: A 1cm stepped ruler. Ideal for making quick boxes
* Design 2: A rule for making lines based on a few common angles and the golden ratio

The thrid file is used for laser cutting. Several of the lines are shared to reduce the cutting time and they are packed for the last space wasted.

When laser cutting, you might need to adjust the SVG file lines. There are three types of actions, cut, line engrave and area engraving. These are specifed by different colors, but some services use the line width as well, so besure to confirm.
